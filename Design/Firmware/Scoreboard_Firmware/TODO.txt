* PRODUCTION *
To produce final production files:
	- turn off debugging statemenmts (SERIAL_DEBUG)
	- set radio channel
	- check radio power (0dbm)
	- check if DMD timers for led panel are auto or manual
	- check the hardware config for master

* HARDWARE *
- add 100K pullup resistor across 3 x LED (from 3V3 line to IO pin) http://www.ti.com/product/PCF8574/datasheet/application_and_implementation#SCPS1972306
- set the RF power back to high (add some capacitors to see if it fixes the power issue)
- add a piezo buzzer for low power warning

* DEBUGGING *
- web controller causes the timer on field 2 to flash when starting in dual screen
- if controller is turned on and signal present, there is a very slight red flash
- brightness on dual screen for screen 2 doesn't work - only screen 1
- panel heartbeat LED doesn't work
- fix the hardware test sketch

* FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
- look at power management for the web controller / sleep the ESP8266
- make the font14 16 pixels high
- make the font44 46 pixels high
- save the score and match start time in eeprom or flash (reset to zero after a couple of hours)
- add a set the real time clock option

* ULCD (DEPRECATED) *
- check battery voltage divider - measure with a multimeter
- some 'back' buttons are red and some are green - make them all same same
- updates after setting the score are a bit flickery
- fix the spinner - its still crap
- add a battery indicator, wireless and offline on each page
- look at power management / low power mode / dim the ulcd etc
- make a clock icon
- the garbage bin on field 1 and field 2 seems to be a toggle / after erasing it needs to go back to normal (not grey)
- fix the flicker when you set the score
- see if can get rid of 'mounting' on startup
- convert the clock on the ulcd to run automatically using a ulcd timer event?
- add sounds
- work out how to disable field 2 if unused?

* DONE *
- add web interface or a relay box from the controller
- add more controllers - 1 to n
- add indicator if controller is turned on but no signal present (red flash)
- set different kinds of scoreboard types ('real' board, mini etc)
- the battery icon occasionally goes out of range
- why does the splash screen flip to the main page so quickly?
- swap around the controls on the main page because they look silly
- fix the brightness
- the brightness slider seems to be 0-7 = make it 0-6
- make a settings icon
- something is screwy with field 2 scores on dual field mode
- fix the battery indicator
- fix the slight time delay between clocks
- clean out the serial code / convert to run on a nano
- fix the timer reset "Yes" button so it goes back to the timer page
- fix the scoreboard reset button so it actually does does something
- check the small buttons on Field1 and Field 2 aren;t obscured
- put all the print and utility functions in a header
- add an offline mode
- add 3 digits up to 199
- add a bugs splash screen
- fix the skip button
- field 1 and field 2 pages - change visitors to guests
- all pages - put the back button in the same place and same color
- one of the little clock buttons is blue, not green
- change the backcolor on the sliders to something like black
